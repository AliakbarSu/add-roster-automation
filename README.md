# Roster Automation
This is an automation tool is built using puppeteer that copies roster from a website and create crosponding events on Google Calander. I used this tool to upload my rosters to google calander as that's my go-to calander app.
To use the tool you'll need credentials to the roster website and a google account along with an access_token. 

## Using it locally
- clone the repo
- add calander id to the .env file
- store the access_token inside token.js file
- add credentials to the .env file
- ``` npm install ```
- ``` npm run start ```
